subtitle: Calculation of water tank size

For each of the residents, an estimated water usage is calculated, see the table below. From the the daily and yearly water usage for the entire building is calculated. Hence, the average daily water usage per person per year in the building is estimated at 47.15m3. However, the size of the water tank is determined by the necessary size that it requires to serve as a rainwater buffer. 

During a storm with a 100-year recurrence interval, which takes 8 hours, 86.2mm of rainfall are expected (STOWA, 2019). With a total plot area at the Schieblock of 8000m2, 80% of the plot is expected to be paved. Hence, the water tank needs to be 551.68m3. 

*86.2mm * (8000m3 * 0.8) = 551.68m3*
