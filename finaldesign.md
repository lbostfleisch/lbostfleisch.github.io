After refining the building shape and assigning the facade types in Houdini, the final design of the building was rendered in twin motion. Then, from this we created a collage as you can see below.

To see how the building fits into the surrounding, an urban plan for AFFINITY was created with its direct surroundings in Rotterdam. Further, an urban collage was created with Google Earth to visualize the surroundings. .
