<h1>General Concept</h1>

<p>With the goal of creating a final building model to complete the existing Schieblock in Rotterdam, this page serves a display of the involved design process, hard & soft criteria, and the final building model. 
    The steps we followed are: intial design process, massing, tuning, modelling, materialization, and the final design. 
    All steps can be followed in the website header, which link you to the corresponding page with more indepth information about each step. 
    In the link "project overview", you can follow the site and building requirements, as well as the general idea of the project.
    Lastly, the section "reflection" serves as an insight into the design process and the challenges on the way. Here, you can also find all of our final deliverables of the project.</p>

<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>We are a group of four students from TU Delft following the minor "Spatial Computing for Sustainable Design". This website serves as a showcase of what we have worked on in the past 3 months of the course.
    We hope you enjoy looking into our project and what we have worked on over the last few months. 
    Best, 
    Celia [lastname], Alexia [lastname], Hugo [lastname], Luca Boestfleisch
